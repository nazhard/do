<div align=center>
        
  ## do
  ###### _script runner_
  
</div>

```sh
>> do test
./scripts/test
or
./scripts/test.sh

>> do . test
./test
or
./test.sh
```

## Why?

Well, this is just a fad project.
But, I would like to try adding some features:
- [x] run the script in the ./scripts/ directory
- [x] run the script in the current directory
- [ ] configuration. For easier customization
- [ ] goroutines to run multiple scripts at the same time
- [ ] and probably some other ideas. I dunno
